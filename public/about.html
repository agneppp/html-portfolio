  <h2>Experience, Knowledge and Skills:</h2>
  <p>I have been playing the piano for more than 30 years, since early childhood. 
    Over the years I have participated in piano master classes with international concert pianists and professors Nelly Ben-Or, Penelope Roskell, Murray McLachlan, Menahem Pressler, Maurizio Moretti, Werner BÃ¤rtschi, Michael Levinas, etc. 
    I have held concerts as a soloist, a concertmaster, and a member of chamber ensemble (in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, and Lithuania). I won prizes in several international piano competitions in Lithuania and Italy.</p>
    <p>I am a professional, passionate and experienced piano teacher. Several of my students won the First Place or High commended in various Piano festivals/ competitions in the UK and Lithuania (e. g. most recent Windsor Piano Festival, Blackheath Music Festival, the Jacques Samuel Piano Festival); and passed the ABRSM exams (many of them with distinction or merit).</p>
